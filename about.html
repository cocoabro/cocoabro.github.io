<h1>I am a designer, developer, and a creator</h1>

<blockquote>
Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. 
Design is how it works. <emphasis>– Steve Jobs</emphasis>
</blockquote>

<emphasis>I am passionate for software that does more than just look good, but software that works good, too.</emphasis>

<p>Hey there, I'm a Software Engineer based out of Las Vegas. I'm heavily focused on iOS development, as well as learning real principles and concepts of Computer Science. This is where I keep all of my learning and understanding of the concepts.</p>
