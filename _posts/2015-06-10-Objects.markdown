# Starting Off

This is a general understanding of the current courses for Object Oriented Programming. This is by no way meant to be perfect, or 100% accurate. These notes are meant to be a memory store of what I am currently learning â€“ perhaps in the future this will be further improved but the fastest way to get the content out here is by ignoring proper english structure. 

# Object Lifetime

To create an object, you have a customer class, you want to make a customer object i.e. customer fred = new Customer();

You can do this in several different programming languages.

Java: 
``` java
Java Customer fred = new Customer();
```
C#:
``` csharp
C# Customer fred = new Customer();
```
VB.NET:
``` vb
VB.NET dim fred As New Customer
```
Ruby:
``` ruby
Ruby fred = Customer.new
```
C++:
``` c++
Customer *fred = new Customer();
```
ObjC:
``` objc
Objective-C Customer *fred = [[Customer [[alloc] init];
```

All of these essentially mean the same thing, we create our object class, or struct and from there we instantiate that object by performing the above syntax in your desired language.

# Overlay

The ``` .overlay-desc ``` allows for your text to hover in a flex-box over your video background, this resizes along with the size of the viewport.

<blockquote>Setting the .video.bgvid style to max-width is the trick to having your header make it full width.</blockquote>
