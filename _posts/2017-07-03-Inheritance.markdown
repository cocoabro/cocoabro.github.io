# Inheritance

One of the four key concepts of object-orientation. 

Inheritance describes an "IS A" Relationship. For instance, can you describe something such as: 

* A car is a vehicle.
* A bus is a vehicle. 

Or you could also use other examples like: 

* An employee is a person
* A customer is a person

However, you can't use other terms because they simply do not make any sense:

* A car is a bus
* A customer is a shopping cart. 

You could also go as far as even saying: 

* A checking account is a kind of bank account.
* A savings account is a type of bank account. 

We know what makes sense and what doesn't. Inheritance allows us to borrow from the parent class, such as that if you have a class Car, and we would like to know if: 

* A Bentley Continental GT is a car is a vehicle. 
* A Pomeranian is a dog is a mammal is an animal. 

Inheritance is to allow us to identify shared attributes and behaviours between objects and avoiding reinventing the wheel. 

# UML Representation of Inheritance

To identify Inheritance in UML, it is normally represented by open ended arrows pointing to your main class as displayed in the screenshot below.
